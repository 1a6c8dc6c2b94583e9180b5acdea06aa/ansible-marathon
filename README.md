ansible-marathon
=============

Marathon Playbook for Ansible with Haproxy support.

This playbook will install Marathon and relies on the Mesos playbook along with haproxy.

Support open source!

## How to use this playbook?

See this sample [playbook](https://github.com/AnsibleShipyard/ansible-galaxy-roles/blob/master/playbook.yml)
which shows how to use this playbook as well as others. It is part of [ansible-galaxy-roles](https://github.com/AnsibleShipyard/ansible-galaxy-roles) and
serves as a curation (and thus an example) of all our ansible playbooks.

You can also view another [sample playbook](https://github.com/mhamrah/ansible-mesos-playbook) which leverages this role to build a mesos cluster with separate master and slave nodes.
